June 24, 2022 - The band [Porcupine Tree](https://porcupinetree.com/)
just released an album called [Closure / Continuation](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/porcupine-tree/closure-continuation/).

Yes, `Cont.hs` is just a practical joke on closures and continuations and
Haskell.

This is my way to celebrate the release :^)
